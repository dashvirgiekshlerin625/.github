## 💡 My Approach to Development  
I believe in writing clean, modular, and well-documented code. I prioritize performance, security, and user experience in every project I work on. I’m a strong advocate for test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices. Collaboration and communication are key to my workflow, and I enjoy working in agile environments where ideas can flourish.

I’m currently exploring:  
- **Machine Learning**: Building and deploying ML models using TensorFlow and PyTorch.  
- **Blockchain**: Developing decentralized applications (dApps) with Ethereum and Solidity.  
- **Open Source**: Contributing to open-source projects and sharing knowledge with the community.
